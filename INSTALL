1) Ensure correct header files
   - fcping requires certain kernel header files to be exported
     or it cannot be compiled. These header files were included
     in the 2.6.31 Linux kernel. If you are using a distribution
     kernel that is >= 2.6.31 then you shouldn't have to take
     this step. If you are building your own kernel or are using
     a pre-2.6.31 kernel you will need to take this step to
     export the appropriate header files.

   # pushd <kernel-src>
   # make headers_install
   # PWD=`pwd`
   # ln -s $PWD/usr/include/scsi/scsi_bsg_fc.h /usr/include/scsi/
   # ln -s $PWD/usr/include/scsi/fc /usr/include/scsi/fc
   # popd

2) Bootstrap, configure, make and make install
   # ./bootstrap.sh
   # rpm --eval "%configure" | sh
   # make
   # make install
