*fcoeadm* -h|--help

*fcoeadm* -v|--version

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *fcoeadm* utility is the Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) management
tool for the _Open-FCoE_ project.  *fcoeadm* may be used to create,
destroy, and reset an FCoE instance on a given network interface. For these
operations *fcoeadm* sends a command to a running *fcoemon* process, via a
socket interface. *fcoemon* will then perform the requested operation.

*fcoeadm* also provides options to query information about FCoE instances,
including interface information, target information, LUN information, and port
statistics. For much of this information, *fcoeadm* relies on the _libhbalinux_
implementation of the _HBA API_.

OPTIONS
-------
*-c*, *--create* _ethX_::
	Creates an FCoE instance based on the specified network interface.
	Note that if there is not an fcoemon configuration file for the
	interface (/etc/fcoe/cfg-ethX, see *fcoemon*), then the created
	FCoE instance will not require DCB.

*-d*, *--destroy* _ethX_::
	Destroys the FCoE instance on the specified network interface.

*-r*, *--reset* _ethX_::
	Resets the FCoE instance on the specified network interface.

*-i*, *--interface* [_ethX_]::
	Show information about the FCoE instance on the specified network
	interface, or all FCoE instances if no network interface is specified.

*-S*, *--Scan* _ethX_::
	Validates that the interface name has an active FCoE session.

*-t*, *--target* [_ethX_]::
	Show information about the discovered targets associated with the
	FCoE instance on the specified network interface.
	If no network interface is specified, information about discovered
	targets from all FCoE instances will be shown.

*-l*, *--lun* [_ethX_]::
	Show detailed information about the discovered SCSI LUNs associated
	with the FCoE instance on the specified network interface.
	If no network interface is specified, information about SCSI LUNs
	from all FCoE instances will be shown.

*-s*, *--stats* _ethX_ [_interval_]::
	Show the statistics (including FC4 statistics) of the FCoE
	interface on the specified network interface.
	The information will be display in one line on the screen per given
	time interval. _interval_ should be specified in whole integers
	greater than 0. It specifies the time interval in the unit of
	seconds. If _interval_ is not specified, the default interval is
	one second.

*-h*, *--help*::
	Displays the usage message of the *fcoeadm* command.

*-v*, *--version*::
	Displays the version of the *fcoeadm* command.

EXAMPLES
--------
Creates an FCoE instance on eth2.101

	fcoeadm -c eth2.101

Destroys the FCoE instance on eth2.101

	fcoeadm -d eth2.101

Resets the FCoE instance on eth2.101

	fcoeadm -r eth2.101

Show the information of all the adapters and their ports having FCoE
instances created

	fcoeadm -i

Show the information of all FCoE instances on interface eth3.

	fcoeadm -i eth3

Show the information of all the discovered targets from all the ports
having FCoE instances created (they may be on different adapter cards).
A brief listing of discovered LUNs are listed after the target they are
associated with, if any

	fcoeadm -t

Show the information of all the discovered targets from a given port (eth3)
having FCoE instance created. A brief listing of discovered LUNs are listed
after each target they are associated with, if any

	fcoeadm -t eth3

Show the detailed information of all the LUNs discovered on all FCoE
connections

	fcoeadm -l

Show the detailed information of all the LUNs associated with a specific
interface

	fcoeadm -l eth3.101

Show the statistics information of a specific port eth3 having FCoE
instances created. The statistics are displayed one line per time interval.
The default interval is one second if an interval is not specified

	fcoeadm -s eth3

	fcoeadm -s eth3 3
